5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## Contact Form & Email Setup
The contact form sends emails to `pandeykartikeya313@gmail.com` when users submit messages. To enable this functionality:

1. **Gmail Setup:**
   - Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account

   Message:
   [user's message]
